                        <p class="text-center card-text" style="color: #edf2f4;">A razor-sharp satire set in Texas during America's war in Iraq, it explores the gaping national disconnect between the war at home and the war abroad.Ben Fountain’s remarkable debut novel follows the surviving members of the heroic
                            Bravo Squad through one exhausting stop in their media-intensive "Victory Tour" at Texas Stadium, football mecca of the Dallas Cowboys, their fans, promoters, and cheerleaders.<br></p>

                        <p class="text-center" style="color: #edf2f4;">I thought this book overall was very well done and well crafted. There was great character development throughout it, and the satirical elements and language made it a very entertaining read, while at the same time discussing important
                            topics such as the toll of war, and the American mindset. It's language makes it more laid back than serious, which I enjoyed because I don't really consider myself a big reader. There weren't many characters to keep track
                            of, which I enjoyed, and since the timeline of this novel is only over the course of a couple of hours, it made it a very interesting read.</p>

                        <p class="text-center" style="color: #edf2f4;">“An inspired, blistering war novel…Though it covers only a few hours, the book is a gripping, eloquent provocation. Class, privilege, power, politics, sex, commerce and the life-or-death dynamics of battle all figure in Billy Lynn’s
                            surreal game day experience.” (New York Times)<br></p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: #edf2f4;">“A masterful echo of ‘Catch-22,’ with war in Iraq at the center. …a gut-punch of a debut novel…There’s hardly a false note, or even a slightly off-pitch one, in Fountain’s sympathetic, damning and structurally ambitious novel.”
                            (Washington Post)<br></p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: #edf2f4;">“Ben Fountain combines blistering, beautiful language with razor-sharp insight…and has written a funny novel that provides skewering critiques of America’s obsession with sports, spectacle, and war.” (Huffington Post)<br></p>

                        <p class="text-center card-text" style="color: #edf2f4;">A hurricane is building over the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the coastal town of Bois Sauvage, Mississippi, and Esch's father is growing concerned. A hard drinker, largely absent, he doesn't show concern for much else. Esch and
                            her three brothers are stocking food, but there isn't much to save. Lately, Esch can't keep down what food she gets; she's fourteen and pregnant. Her brother Skeetah is sneaking scraps for his prized pitbull's new litter, dying
                            one by one in the dirt. Meanwhile, brothers Randall and Junior try to stake their claim in a family long on child's play and short on parenting.<br>As the twelve days that make up the novel's framework yield to their dramatic
                            conclusion, this unforgettable family--motherless children sacrificing for one another as they can, protecting and nurturing where love is scarce--pulls itself up to face another day.<br></p>

                        <p class="text-center" style="color: #edf2f4;">For me, this book was incredibly well written. I loved how it was set in a time and place that most people are familiar with (Hurrican Katrina), and the events of the book may as well have been real events that happend to an actual
                            family. There was great character development, especially between Skeetah and China, and it was the only book we read this semester that was told from a narrator's perspective, and not in 3rd person, which made it much more
                            interesting.</p>

                        <p class="text-center" style="color: #edf2f4;">"A taut, wily novel, smartly plotted and voluptuously written. It feels fresh and urgent, but it’s an ancient, archetypal tale . . . Jesmyn Ward makes beautiful music, plays deftly with her reader’s expectations." - Parul Sehgal,&nbsp;<em>New York Times Book Review</em><br></p>
                        <p
                            class="text-center" style="color: #edf2f4;"><em>"Salvage the Bones</em>&nbsp;is an intense book, with powerful, direct prose that dips into poetic metaphor . . . the story is told with such immediacy and openness . . . That close-knit familial relationship is vivid and compelling,
                            drawn with complexities and detail." -&nbsp;<em>Los Angeles Times</em><br></p>
                            <p class="text-center" style="color: #edf2f4;">"The novel's hugeness of heart and fierceness of family grip and hold on like Skeetah's pit bull." - Ellen Feldman,&nbsp;<em>O, the Oprah Magazine</em><br></p>
